Extend the power of Strings in Swift.

## Getting Started

You can easily add as a requirement with SwiftPM.

### Know what youâ€™re doing?

Here are some quick copypastas for you
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/swiftpackages/SuperString.git", from: "1.0.0"),
```
```swift
.product(name: "SuperString", package: "SuperString"),
```

### Need a reminder?

Your `Package.swift` file should look something like this

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "SuperCoolProject",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "SuperCoolProject",
            targets: ["SuperCoolProject"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swiftpackages/SuperString.git", from: "1.0.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "SuperCoolProject",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "SuperString", package: "SuperString"),
            ]),
        .testTarget(
            name: "SuperCoolProject",
            dependencies: ["SuperCoolProject"])
    ]
)
```

## Usage

Currently there is `camelcamed`, `kebabcased`, and `snakecased`.

```swift
"ThisIs a Cool string".camelcase() // thisIsACoolString

"ThisIs a Cool string".camelcase(.upper) // ThisIsACoolString

"ThisIs a Cool string".kebabcased() // this-is-a--cool-string

"ThisIs a Cool string".snakecased() // this_is_a__cool_string
```
